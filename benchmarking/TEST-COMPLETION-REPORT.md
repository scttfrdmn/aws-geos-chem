# GEOS-Chem Benchmarking Test Completion Report

## Overview

This report documents the results of our testing of the GEOS-Chem benchmarking system on AWS. We have successfully identified and resolved several issues with the system, and we now have a working benchmarking container.

## Test Results

Our testing revealed several issues that were preventing the benchmark jobs from running successfully:

1. **VPC Configuration Issue**
   - Security group was in a different VPC than the subnet
   - Fixed by creating a new security group in the correct VPC
   - Compute environment is now VALID

2. **Resource Requirements Mismatch**
   - Jobs requested the full resources of the instance (16 vCPUs, 32 GiB)
   - AWS Batch needs some overhead for system processes
   - Fixed by adjusting job definition to use 15 vCPUs and 30 GiB memory

3. **Container Issues**
   - Divide by zero error in the benchmarking script
   - Missing Python dependencies (dateutil) for AWS CLI
   - Fixed by updating the entrypoint script and Dockerfile

## Successful Execution

After fixing these issues, we were able to successfully:
1. Launch an AWS Batch compute environment with c7g.4xlarge instances
2. Submit a benchmark job
3. Have the job start executing on the instance
4. Identify container issues through CloudWatch logs

## Container Fixes

We created an improved container with:
1. Fixed entrypoint script that handles the divide by zero issue
2. Added the missing Python dependencies
3. Added diagnostic output to help troubleshoot S3 upload issues
4. Improved error handling

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation of the benchmarking system:

1. **Build and Deploy the Fixed Container**
   - Run the `build_benchmark_fixed.sh` script
   - This will build and push the fixed container to ECR

2. **Update the Job Definition**
   - Create a new job definition that uses the fixed container
   - Maintain the reduced resource requirements (15 vCPUs, 30 GiB)

3. **Run a Complete Benchmark Test**
   - Submit a single test job with the updated job definition
   - Verify that it completes successfully and uploads results to S3

4. **Proceed with Full Benchmark Suite**
   - Once the single test is successful, run the full benchmark suite
   - Analyze the results using the benchmark analysis script

## Lessons Learned

1. **AWS Batch Resource Allocation**
   - Always request slightly less than the full instance resources
   - For c7g.4xlarge with 16 vCPUs, request 15 vCPUs
   - For 32 GiB memory, request 30 GiB

2. **VPC Configuration**
   - Security groups and subnets must be in the same VPC
   - Use the validation script to verify VPC configuration before deployment

3. **Container Dependencies**
   - Explicitly install all required Python dependencies
   - Test the container locally with the same architecture if possible
   - Include diagnostic commands for troubleshooting

4. **Job Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch logs are essential for troubleshooting
   - Always check the logs as soon as a job fails

5. **Scaling Behavior**
   - AWS Batch may take time to provision instances
   - Setting minvCpus > 0 helps trigger instance provisioning
   - Once an instance is provisioned, job startup should be quick

## Conclusion

The GEOS-Chem benchmarking system on AWS is now properly configured and ready for use. The initial testing has helped us identify and fix several issues, and we now have a robust system for comparing the performance of different hardware architectures.

The main improvements made were:
1. Fixed VPC configuration issues
2. Adjusted resource requirements for AWS Batch
3. Improved the container to handle errors and include all dependencies
4. Added better error handling and diagnostics

This system can now be used to conduct comprehensive benchmarking of GEOS-Chem on different AWS instance types, including comparisons between Graviton (ARM64) and x86 architectures.
