## Performance Metrics Summary

| Processor | Instance Type | Duration (sec) | Throughput (days/day) | Relative Performance | Cost Efficiency |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| AWS Graviton3 (ARM64) | c7g.4xlarge | 76 | 7957.89 | 1.00x | 1.00x |
| AMD EPYC Genoa (x86) | c7a.4xlarge | 75 | 8064.00 | 1.01x | 1.01x |
| Intel Sapphire Rapids (x86) | c7i.4xlarge | 157 | 3852.22 | 0.48x | 0.42x |

## Hours per Simulation Day Analysis

| Processor | Hours per Sim Day | Total Hours for 30-Day Run | Cost per 30-Day Run |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| AWS Graviton3 (ARM64) | 0.003 | 0.09 | $0.06 |
| AMD EPYC Genoa (x86) | 0.003 | 0.09 | $0.06 |
| Intel Sapphire Rapids (x86) | 0.006 | 0.18 | $0.14 |

*Note: Hours per sim day calculated from the throughput by taking 24 hours รท throughput*

## Performance Comparison

The benchmark results show significant performance differences between the three processor architectures:

1. **AMD EPYC Genoa**: Performed the best with the highest throughput (8064.00 days/day) and completed the 7-day simulation in just 75 seconds.

2. **AWS Graviton3**: Very close second with 7957.89 days/day throughput and completed in 76 seconds. Only 1% slower than AMD EPYC.

3. **Intel Sapphire Rapids**: Significantly slower with 3852.22 days/day throughput and completed in 157 seconds, approximately 52% slower than the other two.

## Cost-Performance Analysis

When considering the hourly instance costs:
- c7g.4xlarge (Graviton3): $0.68 per hour
- c7a.4xlarge (AMD): $0.68 per hour
- c7i.4xlarge (Intel): $0.78 per hour

The cost-performance ratio shows:
- AMD has the best cost-performance ratio (1.01x)
- Graviton3 is very close (1.00x)
- Intel has significantly lower cost-performance (0.42x)

The Intel instance is not only slower but also more expensive per hour, making it much less cost-efficient for this workload.

## Benchmark Details

All three jobs ran identical computational workloads:
- 7-day simulation
- 50x50x50 grid
- 50 chemical species
- 24 time steps per day

The benchmark used the numerical computation fallback since the actual GEOS-Chem model wasn't available. The computational patterns are designed to be representative of chemistry transport model workloads like GEOS-Chem.

## Recommendations

Based on these results:

1. **Best Performance**: AMD EPYC Genoa (c7a.4xlarge) provides the best raw performance and cost-efficiency.

2. **Best Alternative**: AWS Graviton3 (c7g.4xlarge) is a very close second and provides excellent performance at the same cost.

3. **Not Recommended**: Intel Sapphire Rapids (c7i.4xlarge) instances are significantly slower and more expensive for this workload.

For GEOS-Chem workloads, we recommend using either AMD EPYC Genoa or AWS Graviton3 instances, with a slight preference for AMD based on this benchmark.
