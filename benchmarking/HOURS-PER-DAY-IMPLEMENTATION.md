# Hours Per Day Metric Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully added a new "Hours per Simulation Day" metric to the GEOS-Chem AWS benchmarking system. This metric provides a more intuitive way to understand performance compared to the existing "Throughput (days/day)" metric.

## Implementation Details

1. **Updates to benchmarking_entrypoint.sh**:
   - Added calculation for hours per simulation day: `(runtime_seconds / 3600) / simulation_days`
   - Implemented proper error handling for division by zero
   - Added the metric to JSON output in both manifest.json and results.json files

2. **Updates to check_benchmark_status.sh**:
   - Modified to extract and display hours per simulation day in benchmark results
   - Updated comparison report table to include the new metric

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md to document the new metric
   - Updated BENCHMARK-RESULT-SUMMARY.md to reflect the new capability

## Verification

All three processor architectures have been tested with the new metric:

1. **AWS Graviton3 (ARM64)**:
   - Job ID: c860a79b-0835-4adc-9b1e-2bf48a2c4506
   - Successfully calculated hours per simulation day

2. **Intel Sapphire Rapids (x86)**:
   - Job ID: ef2dba85-ed3a-45d3-9a7b-646eac9f23d2
   - Successfully calculated hours per simulation day

3. **AMD EPYC Genoa (x86)**:
   - Job ID: 6e625d98-dc7a-4633-a933-23baeffacaca
   - Successfully calculated hours per simulation day

## Benefits of Hours Per Day Metric

1. **Intuitive Understanding**: Hours per day is more easily understood by users than days per day (throughput)
2. **Direct Cost Calculation**: Hours directly translate to cost (hours Ã— hourly instance cost)
3. **Run Time Estimation**: Makes it easier to estimate how long a simulation will take

## Next Steps

1. Run benchmarks with real GEOS-Chem simulations to get meaningful metrics
2. Update analysis scripts to include the new metric in visualizations
3. Use this metric in performance comparisons across different architectures

## Conclusion

The addition of the "Hours per Simulation Day" metric enhances the GEOS-Chem benchmarking system by providing a more intuitive way to understand and compare performance across different processor architectures. This complements the existing throughput metric and provides users with multiple perspectives on benchmark results.
