# Benchmarking System Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented in the GEOS-Chem AWS benchmarking system.

## 1. Division by Zero Fix

### Issue
The benchmarking system was previously encountering division by zero errors when calculating throughput metrics, especially in cases where simulation duration was very short.

### Fix
- Added proper handling for edge cases in throughput calculation:
  ```bash
  if [ ${DURATION} -eq 0 ]; then
    # Avoid division by zero by setting a default throughput value
    THROUGHPUT="N/A"
    HOURS_PER_DAY="N/A"
  elif [ ${DURATION_DAYS} -eq 0 ]; then
    # If simulation duration is zero days, set throughput to zero
    THROUGHPUT="0.00"
    HOURS_PER_DAY="N/A"  # No meaningful hours per day if no simulation days
  else
    # Calculate metrics normally
    ...
  fi
  ```
- Ensured output JSON properly handles N/A values

## 2. Docker Platform Flag Warnings

### Issue
The Docker build process was generating platform flag warnings when using `FROM` statements in Dockerfiles.

### Fix
- Removed platform flags from Dockerfile FROM statements:
  ```dockerfile
  # Before
  FROM --platform=linux/arm64 amazonlinux:2023

  # After
  FROM amazonlinux:2023
  ```
- Added platform flags to docker buildx command instead:
  ```bash
  docker buildx build -t ${ECR_REPOSITORY}:${ARCH_TAG} \
      -f ${DOCKERFILE} \
      --platform ${PLATFORM} \
      ...
  ```

## 3. New Benchmark Metric: Hours per Simulation Day

### Enhancement
Added a new performance metric: "Hours per Simulation Day" which calculates wall-clock hours needed to simulate one model day.

### Implementation
- Added calculation: `(runtime_seconds / 3600) / simulation_days`
- Updated JSON output for both manifest.json and results.json
- Updated benchmark status check and reporting to include the new metric

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Better Error Handling**: The system now gracefully handles edge cases that previously caused errors
2. **Cleaner Docker Builds**: No more platform flag warnings during container builds
3. **Enhanced Metrics**: The new hours per day metric provides a more intuitive way to understand performance
4. **Better Documentation**: Updated documentation reflects these improvements

All fixes have been tested and verified across all three processor architectures: AWS Graviton3 (ARM64), Intel Sapphire Rapids (x86), and AMD EPYC Genoa (x86).
