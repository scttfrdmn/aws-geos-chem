# GEOS-Chem Benchmarking System: Final Recommendations

Based on our implementation and testing of the GEOS-Chem benchmarking system, we have compiled the following recommendations for future development and optimization.

## 1. Infrastructure Configuration

### 1.1 VPC Configuration
- **Issue**: Security groups and subnets must be in the same VPC, or the compute environment will be INVALID.
- **Recommendation**: Create a dedicated VPC for the benchmarking system with properly configured security groups and subnets. Use the validation script in `vpc-configuration-troubleshooting.md` to verify VPC configuration before deployment.

### 1.2 Architecture-Specific Compute Environments
- **Issue**: AWS Batch cannot mix ARM64 (Graviton) and x86 instance types in the same compute environment.
- **Recommendation**: Create separate compute environments and job queues for each architecture:
  - `geos-chem-graviton` for ARM64 instances (c7g, c6g)
  - `geos-chem-x86` for x86 instances (c6i, m6i)

### 1.3 Resource Requirements
- **Issue**: AWS Batch reserves some resources for system overhead, so requesting 100% of an instance's resources causes jobs to remain in RUNNABLE state.
- **Recommendation**: Configure job definitions to request slightly less than the total available resources:
  - For c7g.4xlarge (16 vCPUs, 32 GiB): Request 15 vCPUs, 30 GiB memory
  - Update `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to match vCPU allocation

## 2. Container Optimization

### 2.1 Multi-Architecture Support
- **Issue**: Building containers for different architectures requires specific configurations.
- **Recommendation**: Maintain separate Dockerfiles or build parameters for ARM64 and x86 architectures. Use `--platform=linux/arm64` for Graviton containers and test thoroughly before deployment.

### 2.2 Container Simplification
- **Recommendation**: Start with simplified containers for testing, then gradually increase complexity. The benchmark container should include only the necessary components to run GEOS-Chem and report metrics.

### 2.3 Package Conflict Resolution
- **Issue**: Package conflicts when building containers for different architectures.
- **Recommendation**: Use the `--allowerasing` flag with dnf/yum to resolve package conflicts in the Dockerfile.

## 3. AWS Batch Configuration

### 3.1 Compute Environment Sizing
- **Recommendation**: Configure compute environments with appropriate scaling parameters:
  - `minvCpus`: 0 when not in use, 16+ when running benchmarks
  - `maxvCpus`: Based on your budget and performance needs (recommended: 256+)
  - `desiredvCpus`: Manually set to 16+ to trigger instance provisioning when needed

### 3.2 Job Queue Priority
- **Recommendation**: Assign different priorities to job queues to control the order of execution:
  - Higher priority for critical benchmarks
  - Lower priority for exploratory or development benchmarks

### 3.3 Service Quotas
- **Recommendation**: Request increases for relevant service quotas:
  - Running On-Demand Standard instances (current: 640 vCPUs)
  - Batch job concurrency limits

## 4. Benchmark Orchestration

### 4.1 Region Configuration
- **Issue**: Missing region configuration causes "No region" errors in scripts.
- **Recommendation**: Update all scripts to use explicit region configuration:
  - In boto3 clients: `boto3.client('batch', region_name=region)`
  - In environment variables: `export AWS_REGION=us-west-2`
  - In AWS profiles: `aws configure set region us-west-2 --profile aws`

### 4.2 Error Handling
- **Recommendation**: Enhance error handling in the benchmark-orchestrator.py script:
  - Add detailed error messages for common issues
  - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - Implement better logging and monitoring

### 4.3 Job Parameterization
- **Recommendation**: Update the job submission process to include all necessary parameters:
  - Ensure the `configJson` parameter includes all required fields
  - Validate parameters before submission to avoid runtime errors

## 5. Monitoring and Reporting

### 5.1 CloudWatch Dashboards
- **Recommendation**: Create CloudWatch dashboards to monitor benchmarking system:
  - Job success/failure metrics
  - Compute environment scaling metrics
  - Cost metrics by instance type and architecture

### 5.2 Automated Reporting
- **Recommendation**: Implement automated reporting for benchmark results:
  - Comparison dashboard for different architectures
  - Cost efficiency metrics ($/simulation-day)
  - Performance trend analysis over time

### 5.3 Alerting
- **Recommendation**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical conditions:
  - Jobs stuck in RUNNABLE state for too long
  - Compute environment in INVALID state
  - High failure rates for benchmark jobs

## 6. Cost Optimization

### 6.1 Spot Instances
- **Recommendation**: For non-critical benchmarks, consider using Spot instances to reduce costs by up to 70%. Create separate compute environments configured for Spot instances.

### 6.2 Right-Sizing
- **Recommendation**: Regularly analyze benchmark performance data to identify the most cost-effective instance types for different simulation types.

### 6.3 Graviton Adoption
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize Graviton instances where performance is comparable to x86, as they offer better price/performance ratio.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 Troubleshooting Guides
- **Recommendation**: Maintain and expand the troubleshooting documentation:
  - `vpc-configuration-troubleshooting.md`
  - `aws-batch-best-practices.md`
  - Add new guides for common issues as they are discovered

### 7.2 Benchmark Configuration Guide
- **Recommendation**: Create a detailed guide for configuring new benchmarks:
  - Template YAML configurations for different types of benchmarks
  - Best practices for benchmark design
  - Parameter optimization recommendations

### 7.3 Standard Operating Procedures
- **Recommendation**: Develop standard operating procedures for:
  - Regular benchmark execution
  - Results analysis and reporting
  - System maintenance and updates

## 8. Future Enhancements

### 8.1 Web Interface Integration
- **Recommendation**: Complete the integration with the web interface:
  - Real-time job monitoring
  - Interactive results visualization
  - Cost estimation and optimization recommendations

### 8.2 Automated Benchmark Scheduling
- **Recommendation**: Implement automated benchmark scheduling using AWS EventBridge to run benchmarks on a regular cadence (weekly, monthly, etc.).

### 8.3 Machine Learning Optimization
- **Recommendation**: Explore using machine learning to optimize benchmark configurations and predict performance on new instance types.

## Conclusion

The GEOS-Chem benchmarking system on AWS provides a powerful platform for comparing the performance of different hardware architectures and configurations. By implementing these recommendations, the system will become more robust, cost-effective, and easier to maintain. The focus should be on automating as much as possible and providing clear, actionable insights from benchmark results.
